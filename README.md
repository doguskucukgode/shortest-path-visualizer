# Shortest path visualizer
Finds the shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm) between the two given locations in terms of distance or time. Exports map as png format and visializes route. Input file should be located on root folder. Image is exported on root folder as `output.png` 

## Maven
### Running with default options
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mex.shortestpath.main.ShortestPathApplication"  -Dexec.args="-s Subotica -e Ruma -i ./cities.dat"
```
### Running with different width height
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mex.shortestpath.main.ShortestPathApplication"  -Dexec.args="-s Subotica -e Ruma -i ./cities.dat -w 1000 -h 1000"
```
### Running with time based path
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mex.shortestpath.main.ShortestPathApplication"  -Dexec.args="-s Subotica -e Ruma -i ./cities.dat -w 1000 -h 1000 --time-based-path"
```
